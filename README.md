# ECOM STORE API

## Description
This is a ecommerce store api and what it does is that it creates products, categories, and tags to store data and create an api that can send, retrieve, create, and delete data from the ecommerce store. The main reason why I built this was for products and how they can be efficiently organized and stored in categories, and tags. The primary problem I had with this was creating the models and implementing them throughout the database, and navigating the folder structure.

## Installation 
npm i then npm run seed and then node server.js
